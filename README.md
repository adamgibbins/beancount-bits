# beancount-bits
Plugins and importers I use with the plain-text accounting tool [Beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/).

I'm putting there here to show off the power and flexibility of beancount. I use these in my personal beancount setup, 
so some of them probably have hardcoded bits that don't make much sense outside of my setup.

That said, I'd welcome any pull requests to correct any special bits you discover.

Read the header of each file to findout what each plugin does.
